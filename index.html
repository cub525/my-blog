    <h1>Galatians 3 Blog Post</h1>
    <p>
        For a Priests activity, my quorum went to a synagogue. We saw the Torah and talked about Jewish history. Across from the Torah there was a 10-foot bookshelf, filled with books. The Rabbi said that those books comprised the Oral Law, and that he had studied these books for years. One of the reasons the Pharisees did not like the teachings of Jesus was that he did not teach or follow the oral law, which invalidated many of their life studies and threatened their position of power. One of these laws says that any man hung from a tree is accursed of God, and the Pharisees used this to prove that Jesus could not have been the Messiah, as the Messiah would not have been accursed of God. Paul, in his ministry, described Jesus as having been accursed for our sake. In essence Paul said that this section of the Oral law summarized the Condescension of Jesus, and that by doing so He had saved us all.

    <h1>Saturday, 17 July: Message to my Grandsons</h1>
    <p>This week, as I used the clustering study skill, I found a message from James E. Faust, entitled <i>Message to my Grandsons</i><sup><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons?lang=eng">1</a></sup>. I read it, and was fascinated by the way that he gave the talk. I found my testimony of the importance and power of the Priesthood increased, and I resolved to study this talk again. I wrote about it in my journal, and I plan to backreference it once I read it again next month. It's a short post today, but I will have this study change my life. I am making a list of good things to do, because once my Rel 212 class is over I will not stydy the scriptures as deeply or as long. I will make an effort to improve my regular scripture study.</p>
